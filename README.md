# Confusion

This is a website written by React, as part of the course "Front-End Web Development with React", which is taught by [Dr. Jogesh K. Muppala](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~muppala/) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In this course, I have learned to build the website with React in the following areas:

* React Components
* React Router
* Single Page Application
* React Redux
* Redux Forms
* Redux Thunk
* Client-Server Communication

This is a very handful course, which I enjoyed a lot from learning.

## Potential Improvement
The server in this course is a local JSON server, so the website cannot be deployed online yet.
Maybe an online API will be built to server the website in the future.
